# Code Refactoring to Increase Accessibility
## Description 
To increase the website's **accessibility**, I made changes to **html** and **css** files. 
* In **index.html** file, I changed some **non-semantic** elements to **semantic** elements. For example, I used header and footer tags instead of using div and class= "header" or class="footer". I also changed div tags to nav tags or selection tags when necessary and appropriate. 
* In **style.css** file, there were many selectors which had the same format, so I combined them to consolidate the file. In addition, there were many extra codes that did not format anything, so I deleted them. I also arranged selectors to make them flow in order of the html skeleton.
